表语从句在复合句中作表语的名词性从句，放在系动词之后，一般结构是“主语＋连系动词＋表语从句”。可以接表语从句的连系动词有be, look, remain（留下、保持、依然）, seem等。引导表语从句的that常可省略。另外，常用的还有the reason is that… 和It is because 等结构。例如：

1) The question is whether we can make good preparation in such a short time.

2) This is why we can’t get the support of the people.

3) But the fact remains that we are behind the other classes.

4) The reason he is late for school isthat he missed the early bus.
